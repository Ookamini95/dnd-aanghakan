The chosen of [[Elune]], a legendary warrior destined to defend the world in its darkest times. Legends talk about [[Aein]], curator of souls, first of [[The Chosen]], born of the [[Giants]], and how he defeated [[Goor]], king of the Orcs, and his vast armies of chaos. Then there is [[Thein]] the second chosen, born among wolves, pure of soul, untarnished, and bearer of the [[thousand roots]]. Then there is [[Yaohwan]], born of Valkyrie blood, third of the chosen, protector of the people, wise diplomat and architect of the unity in [[Aanghakan]]. He died, thousands of years in the past, leaving a legacy of peace and hope.

But while hope yields prosperity, evil is *always* capable of seeping through the smallest gaps, corrupt the meek, build upon the dark desires of the ones left behind.

Our story begins in the small town of [[Esmeralda]], jewel of boundless pastures, lodged in the plains of the [[Green Sea]], near [[Thunderpeak]].
Our party of yet to be heroes has just completed an humble request of the local tavern owner of moving a shipment of beer and various foods and alcoholic beverages. It appears that our heroes have some kind of basic accommodation at said tavern, "The Stubborn Ol'Mule", in exchange of simple services and mansions for the old owner, which has slowly reached senile age but has made enough to send his son to study smiting at the capital, and thus needs a little hand once in a while.

#Master-Notes
In this section I'll present a couple notes for the master, as in the world building some elements must be necessary in order to maintain a coherent story, while allowing you to create your own world.

Main quest - The following person should be introduced as soon as possible, as it will be the main NPC (or played by someone special) of the quest. Serene, daughter of a retired human warrior and of an half elf from the [[East O'lands]] which is known as the land of the elves. Rumor has it that her mother may be of noble blood due to the her silver hair, but she left early due to an unknown illness. She's (not yet) the next chosen of Elune and, despite her current lack of power, she will be accompanied by the party in the initial stages of her journey.

Previous knowledge - the players know the following things about the area:

- [[Esmeralda]] is the southernmost village in the region, several days from [[Thunderpeak]] and closest to the [[Great Forest]]. 
- The small town has the following features : a *small market* where pelts and grains are exchanged for trinkets and weapons from the capital, a *town square* with a bulletin board and a *town hall*, and a *small church* nearby with a statue dedicated to [[Yannee]], sister of Elune.
- The town's main productions are grains and vegetables. Hunters who live nearby also trade goods in exchange for pelts, bones, and meats.
- The townsfolk are preparing for the traditional spring festivities, and people from nearby settlements are coming to enjoy the nightly party.

The players are then introduced to what they know about the area and the culture and are free to explore the busier than usual town.

When the players get to the town square they can overhear an animate discussion between a merchant and a known hunter of the area [[Hank]]. The discussion seems about a missed deadline of an important shipment of exotic pelts for the capital.

> Hank : I'm desolate sir. 
> Merchant : I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN...
> Hank : Sir please. I have... explained... multiple times... the animals seems to have disappeared.
> Merchant : WHAT. Animals do not disappear, they die, and their pelts get sold off. Who bought my pelts? WHO? AT WHAT PRICE?
> Hank : Sir... If you could wait only a couple days. Just... send your master some excuse for some time... the festival is perfect...
> Merchant : ... You know nothing Hank. If I miss HER birthday, I am dead MEAT! I'd be enjoying my last night in this world.


#Master-Notes If players ignore the conversation, they will be later met by Serene that will hint at [[Hank]], mentioning the return of a favor the hunter did for the party. If it fails, let them enjoy the party, they will be later met by [[Hank]] himself that will propose a job for the team.
