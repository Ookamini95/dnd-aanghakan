[[Giovanna GioGio Brando|GioGio]], having made significant progress in harnessing the geomantic energies through her aerolith crystals, is now on the brink of a groundbreaking (but unstable) discovery.

However, she needs help to test the limits and practical applications of her invention. The aerolith crystal, currently capable of sustaining basic cantrips like _gust_ to simulate extended, controlled bursts of wind, offers a limited form of mobility—not quite flight, but more an enhanced gliding. GioGio seeks adventurous souls to field-test her prototype under various environmental conditions and scenarios.

Players are recruited by GioGio to become her field operatives, testing out her aerolith-powered gliders in different settings—over treacherous mountains, across sprawling deserts, and above turbulent seas. Each test is designed not only to push the technology but also to gather critical data that could unlock further potential of the technology.


#Master-Notes 

```statblock
name: Spell glider
actions:
  - name: Recharge
    desc: As an action, expend one level 1 spell slot to recharge the glider. Once recharged, the glider functions for a full day (24 hours).
  - name: Glide
    desc: While the glider is active, you can use a bonus action to initiate or maintain gliding. Maintaining control during glide requires a successful DC 12 Athletics check.
  - name: Power Glide
    desc: Once per Recharge, upon activation, you can choose to perform a Power Glide. This powerful burst of wind energy allows you to ascend up to 50 meters vertically or to speed forward up to 100 meters horizontally. After using Power Glide, you must succeed on a DC 12 Athletics check to maintain control of the glider due to the sudden burst of speed and altitude change.

traits:
  - name: Weather Dependent
    desc: The effectiveness of the glider can vary with current weather conditions. Weather conditions can make harder to control the glider, requiring a DC 17 instead of a DC 12.
  - name: ads
    desc: The aerolith crystal and mechanical components are delicate. If the glider is subjected to severe impacts or targeted by spells that disrupt magical energies (e.g., Dispel Magic), it requires a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to repair, while the mechanism needs a DC 17 Intelligence (Mechanics).
