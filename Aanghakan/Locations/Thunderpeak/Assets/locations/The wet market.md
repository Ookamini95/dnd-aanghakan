As the day breaks with the clamor of dwarven merchants hawking their wares and the sizzle of freshly caught mountain trout. The air teems with the earthy aroma of local vegetables and the intoxicating scent of dwarven spices from distant corners of the mountains. There's the occasional squawk of a mountain fowl, the haggling over tubers and a selection of local cheeses. It's an intoxicating sensory tapestry that tells a story of sustenance and survival.
