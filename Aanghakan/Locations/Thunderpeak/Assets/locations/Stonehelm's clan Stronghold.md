The **Stonehelm's Clan Stronghold** looms over the [[The wet market|wet market]], as constant as the mountains themselves. Carved into the very heart of the mountain, its fortress-like exterior guards centuries of dwarven history and tradition. Tall, sturdy stone walls shimmer with veins of embedded gems, reflecting the relentless determination of the Stonehelms. Inside, hallways echo with the wisdom of age-old dwarven lords, and grand rooms filled with ancestral relics narrate tales of valor and glory.
