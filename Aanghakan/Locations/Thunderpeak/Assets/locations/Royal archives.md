Deeper within the city, hidden under layers of stone and shrouded in whispers of yore, lie the __Royal Archives.__ Under the diligent guardianship of Stonehelm's clan lorekeeper, [[Chad]], and the equally earnest archivist [[Okin the Wise|Okin]], the archives breathe the very history of the dwarven people. Each meticulously carved shelf and alcove cradles tales penned in ancient scripts, records of legendary battles, and secrets long buried. The thick scent of aged parchment and the soft hum of chronicled wisdom fill the air, weaving an intoxicating tapestry of knowledge that stretches back to the birth of the dwarven race itself. Dimly lit by the eerie glow of luminescent crystals, the Archives serve as a sacred testament to the past, a sanctuary for the preservers of history, and a shrine to the unyielding resolve of the dwarves of Thunderpeak.
