The **Glimmering Anvil Inn**, an establishment known across the land, drawing weary travellers like moths to the flame. A refuge of warmth against the mountain's icy breath, its wooden doors adorned with intricate carvings, ever welcoming. The scent of roasted boar and the muffled sound of merry chatter drift out, an olfactory melody of succulent delights and roaring fireplaces. Inside, tales are woven and friendships forged, all under the glimmering glow of luminescent crystal chandeliers.
