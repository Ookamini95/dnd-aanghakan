Thorin of the [[Oakenshield clan]] was born in Thunderpeak, the grandson of Thack Oakenshield, king of the dwarves. Thorin was a wealthy and powerful king who ruled over the vast lands of [[Geopolitics here - Erebor]], which were rich in gold and precious gems.

However, Erebor was eventually invaded by the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves and claimed the [[Jade mountains]] and its riches for himself.

Thorin, along with many others, became a wanderer, traveling the lands and seeking a way to reclaim Erebor. He formed a band of twelve dwarves and five humans, including his loyal followers [[Balin Stonehelm|Balin]] and Dwalin, and set out on a perilous journey to reclaim their lost kingdom.

Eventually, they arrived at [[Geopolitics here - Erebor]], and Thorin led his forces in a fierce battle against the dragon Smoug. Despite the dragon's immense power, Thorin and his companions were able to defeat him and reclaim [[Geopolitics here - Erebor]].
