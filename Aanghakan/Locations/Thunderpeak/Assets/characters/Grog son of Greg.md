Grog, progeny of Greg the Giant, an unyielding bulwark of the Stonehelm clan. Carved from the same formidable granite as his forebears, this formidable warrior stands steadfast amidst the tumult of the world.

His presence, an embodiment of brooding silence, dwarfs the babbling of words, rendering them insignificant. His hushed demeanor bellies a lethal prowess, a deadly dance of steel and blood. In the throes of battle, he becomes an artist, his canvas the chaos of combat, his brush the keen edge of his blade.

Always at his side a tuft of [[Elven Moongrass]], a mystical herb coveted by the moon-kissed elves. His use of this herb, akin to a ritual, is both a respite and a reflection. Its smoke, sweet and tranquil, ensnares the senses, acting as a gentle balm to the frenetic onslaught of reality, a soothing caress against the harsh grain of the world. In its intoxicating embrace, even a hardened warrior like Grog finds a moment of solace, an ephemeral respite amidst the ceaseless battle of existence.

Grog a paragon of silent strength and lethal might. In the clamor of swords and shields, amidst the howling chaos of the world, he is the silent stone against which the tide of conflict breaks, yet he stands, unmoving, unbroken, unstoppable.

He is the [[Stonehelm Clan]] Battlemaster.
