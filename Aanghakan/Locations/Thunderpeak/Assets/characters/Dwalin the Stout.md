Dwalin the Stout was born in [[Thunderpeak]] to a family of skilled blacksmiths. From a young age, he showed a natural talent for working with metals and quickly became an apprentice in his family's forge. As he grew older, he honed his skills and developed a reputation for creating some of the finest weapons and armor in all of Thunderpeak.

Dwalin's skill as a blacksmith caught the attention of the city's ruling council, who commissioned him to create weapons and armor for the city's elite guard. His work proved to be so impressive that word quickly spread throughout Thunderpeak, and soon dwarves from all over the city were coming to Dwalin's forge to commission their own weapons and armor.

Over time, Dwalin's reputation grew beyond Thunderpeak, and his work became known throughout the entire region. He began receiving requests for his creations from outside the city, and his work was soon being sought after by kings and warlords alike.

Despite his growing fame, Dwalin remained true to his roots and continued to work in his family's forge in [[Thunderpeak]].
