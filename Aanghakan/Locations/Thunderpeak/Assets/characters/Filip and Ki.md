A curious symbiosis of man and dwarf, their collective spirits etched by the unyielding grip of the mines. Filip, a man of human stock, his face weathered like an old map, each line a testament to the trials endured in the belly of the earth. His hands, calloused from the weight of his responsibility, his eyes, once brimming with a miner's unquenchable ambition, now flicker with a fear that permeates the cavernous expanse of the Crystal Caves. Yet, in his trembling gaze lies not just fear, but a glimmer of faithlful hope.

Beside him, the specter of Ki lingers. Stout-hearted and unyielding as the stone she hails from, this dwarven maidenâ€™s absence echoes loudly through the mines. The riddle of her disappearance is woven into the very sinew of the caves, a thread intertwined with the fate of the world above.
