Thunderpeak is gripped by fear as a series of grisly killings shakes the city. The victims seem random, their deaths brutal and without apparent motive. The city guard is overwhelmed, and rumors and suspicion are spreading like wildfire. The party stumbles upon this mystery when they find a cryptic list - names marked with dates, some crossed out, and others yet to come.

2. **Protect Potential Victims:** Identify and safeguard individuals on the list who have not yet been targeted.
3. **Uncover the Motive:** Delve into the backgrounds of the victims to understand the killer's intent.
4. **Apprehend the Killer:** Track down and confront the murderer, bringing them to justice.

- **Local Healer or Cleric:** Provides insights into the nature of the injuries and deaths.
- **Informant:** A shady character who might have information about the killer or the victims.
- **Surviving Victim:** Someone who narrowly escaped, possibly providing a crucial clue.
