### Summary

A long-forgotten manuscript has surfaced from the [[Royal archives]], revealing the location of an hidden entrance to the [[Crystal Caverns]] within the Jade Mountains. 

#Master-Notes The only known way to enter the crystal cavern is located near the temple to [[Yaohwan]], located just outside the city. [[The Siege of Thunderpeak|Due to the city being under siege]], such entrance is blocked off but our heroes may have a couple days of advantage over the cultists, as information about the entrance is [[Like Rats in a Cellar|unknown to the outside enemy forces]].

#Master-Notes The manuscript contains illustrations of places, sketched by an explorer whose name has been lost to the annals of time.
