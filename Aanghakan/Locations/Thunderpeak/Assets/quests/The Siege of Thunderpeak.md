A rival faction, the [[Cult of the abyssal serpent]], has laid siege to Thunderpeak, threatening the city's safety. The cult's members believe that obtaining the Heart of the Mountain will grant them the power to bring their god into the mortal world, and they are willing to do anything to achieve their goal. Their forces are composed of cultists, summoned fiends, and serpentine monsters. 
An immense army is facing the city, just at the beginning of the narrow gap that leads to the city.

The end of the day is near, and the enemy army appears to be retreating over the valley. The resilience of the dwarven fortress is impressive, impenetrable walls, hardened by the many battles of the old ages. The dwarven spirit is unbroken: many take out their armor to party over the good fight, many start heavy driking and even some brawls spur around the plaza, organized as a makeshift operational base for the army.

In a small alley around the camp our heroes take rest while discussing on the next steps.
