### Summary

A rival faction, the [[Cult of the abyssal serpent]], has laid siege to Thunderpeak, threatening the city's safety. The cult's members believe that obtaining the Heart of the Mountain will grant them the power to bring their god into the mortal world, and they are willing to do anything to achieve their goal. Their forces are composed of cultists, summoned fiends, and serpentine monsters. 
An immense army is facing the city, just at the beginning of the narrow gap that leads to the city. 

> *Dwarf scout* : Destroy the bridge! 
> *HORNS*

The destruction of the bridge stalls the enemy's advance, leaving them temporarily incapacitated. They are left with no choice but to set up camp and begin preparations for a siege.

#Master-Notes This unexpected respite gives our heroes a chance to regroup, recuperate, and continue exploring the capital. 

In [[Thunderpeak]], the dwarves are a whirl of activity. Preparing for a siege is second nature to them, a rite etched into their ancestral memory by the harsh trials of history. The clang of hammers on metal resounds through the streets, the deep rhythm of a city preparing for war.

The dwarven stonemasons inspect the walls, tracing their fingers over the cool stone, marking any weak spots for repair. They move with a steady, reassuring rhythm, their craftsmanship a testament to their enduring strength. As they work, they chant old songs of fortitude and resilience, their deep voices creating a haunting melody that echoes through the city.

In the heart of the city, the forges blaze brighter than ever. Sparks fly as dwarven smiths, faces stern with determination, work tirelessly. Armor and weapons are crafted, each a masterpiece of dwarven engineering. Warriors queue to receive their equipment, their eyes burning with a fervor to protect their city.

The runesmiths, wise and solemn, delve into their ancient texts. They conjure enchantments to bolster the city's defenses and weaponry. A soft glow emanates from the city walls as these ancient protectors weave their magic, creating a shimmering barrier of energy.

In the taverns, the dwarven spirit is not dampened. They drink deeply, sing loudly, and tell stories of past victories. These gatherings are more than just relaxation; they are a ritual to stoke the fires of camaraderie and resilience, to remind each dwarf that they are part of a history of heroes, and they, too, will hold the line when the siege arrives.

The moon's light was obscured, plunging the night into a deeper darkness than the city had ever known. Whispers of unease fluttered among the guards on the city walls. In the distance, near the edge of the chasm, torchlights revealed a sinister caravan, cloaked in shadowy hues and marked with symbols of the abyssal serpent. The caravan was unlike any the city had seen, with cages rattling with the desperate cries of the tormented and monstrous shapes lurking within.

From this caravan emerged a hooded figure, garbed in dark robes stained with blood and scales resembling those of serpents. With a staff carved from bone, the figure drew ominous symbols on the ground, each radiating an otherworldly, malevolent energy. The air became thick, and the winds carried the distant, sorrowful hymns of the damned.

As the climax of their ritual approached, gargantuan tentacles, scales glinting with bioluminescent patterns, erupted from the depths and anchored onto the city's walls, pulling the city closer to the chasm's edge inch by inch and providing safe bridges for the invading forces. 

The path to the city is now open.

The siege is a bloody spectacle, with the enemy deploying goblins, fiends, and all manner of abhorrent creatures. Huge boulders and crab-like monsters are hurled towards the city walls, their impact partly absorbed by magical shields. Ladders, harpoons, and siege towers provide means to surmount the formidable city walls, a task made easier by the sheer number of the besieging forces.

#Master-Notes Sieges are desperate times that can create moments for heroism. Whether it's a daring sortie against the enemy, a stealth mission to sabotage their siege equipment, or a powerful ritual to strengthen the city's defenses, these high-risk, high-reward scenarios can provide exciting opportunities for the characters to shine.

The resilience of the dwarven fortress of Thunderpeak shines through. Impenetrable walls, hardened by countless battles of old, hold back the onslaught. The dwarven spirit remains unbroken. As the day draws to a close, the enemy army begins a reluctant retreat. In the plaza, makeshift as an operational base for the army, many dwarves shed their armor to celebrate their stand. Heavy drinking ensues, even a few good-natured brawls, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the dwarves.

As the celebrations rage on, our heroes decide what to do next, while a familiar figure is calmly approaching the party. [[Okin the Wise|Okin]] is the bearer of [[The Lost Mines of Thunderpeak|great news]], as a matter of great importance has arisen from the [[Royal archives]], and will lead the party to the [[Stonehelm's clan Stronghold]] in order to meet the [[Balin Stonehelm|king himself]].
