In the midst of war preparations and siege, a troubling rumor stirs within Thunderpeak's protective walls: a covert group of Abyssal Serpent cultists have infiltrated the city. Vital information about the city's defenses, and worse still, the expedition for the Heart of the Mountain, has leaked to the enemy. 

Prudence and circumspection become paramount in managing details of the mission. Even the faintest whisper in the wrong ears could spell disaster. The invisible enemy lurking within the city's confines presents an urgent threat that demands immediate attention. Ignoring them would be akin to letting a serpent coil around one's ankle, dangerous and foolish.

Unveiling this concealed menace and ensuring the city's defenses remain a mystery to our adversaries becomes a mission just as critical as the expedition itself. A failure to root out this internal threat could turn the search for the artifact into a suicide mission. The artifact, the Heart of the Mountain, must not fall into the wrong hands.
