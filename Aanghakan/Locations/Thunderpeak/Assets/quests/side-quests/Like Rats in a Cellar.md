In the midst of war preparations and siege, a troubling rumor stirs within Thunderpeak's protective walls: a covert group of Abyssal Serpent cultists have infiltrated the city. Vital information about the city's defenses, and worse still, the expedition for the Heart of the Mountain, has leaked to the enemy. 

Prudence and circumspection become paramount in managing details of the mission. Even the faintest whisper in the wrong ears could spell disaster. The invisible enemy lurking within the city's confines presents an urgent threat that demands immediate attention. Ignoring them would be akin to letting a serpent coil around one's ankle, dangerous and foolish.

Unveiling this concealed menace and ensuring the city's defenses remain a mystery to our adversaries becomes a mission just as critical as the expedition itself. A failure to root out this internal threat could turn the search for the artifact into a suicide mission. The artifact, the Heart of the Mountain, must not fall into the wrong hands.

#Master-Notes **Here are some potential objectives for the Abyssal Serpent cultists** :

- *A passage through the mountains :* a covert passage to the [[Crystal Caverns]] lies a day's march from the city. If found, the cultist may have a real shot at the [[Hearth of the Mountain]]. 
- *A Wrench in the Works :* sabotage has long been a favored tool of subterfuge. A well-executed disruption could significantly impact the party's plans and force them to adapt on the fly.
- *A Deadly Shadow :* given their infiltration, the cultists could potentially leverage the element of surprise for an assassination. With a potent poison and meticulous planning, they could strike at the heart of Thunderpeak's leadership.
