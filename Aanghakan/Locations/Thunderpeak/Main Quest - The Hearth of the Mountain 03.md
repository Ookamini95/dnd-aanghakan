After a long and difficult journey, our heroes have finally reached the capital of [[Erebor|Erebor,]] [[Thunderpeak]]

#Master-Notes The questing party may have a respite in order to explore the city

![[Thunderpeak]]

Several days pass by, and the party member has had the opportunity to showcase their skills within the city whilst searching for information about [[Okin the Wise|Okin]]. After gaining some notoriety, or by igniting the archivist's curiosity, it is possible to meet directly with [[Okin the Wise|Okin]] and talk to him.

#Master-Notes The conversation with [[Okin the Wise]] should be a *revealing plot twist* to the players, the following talk points are advised :

- [[Okin the Wise|Okin]] had been searching for information about the [[Cult of the abyssal serpent|cult]] since the massacre in [[Esmeralda]]
- The deity known as the [[Abyssal Serpent]] had been banished long ago into another unspecified dimension, and the keys to such domain had been reforged into magical artifacts.
- The [[Hearth of the Mountain]] is one of such artifacts. Hidden within the depths of the [[Crystal Caverns]], this gem was once believed to be lost. Retrieving it may prove a challenge as the entrance to the caverns is under the enemy's control.
- The prophecy foretells the Abyssal Serpent's return when the artifacts are reunited; a disaster that [[Okin the Wise|Okin]] would like to prevent. [[Okin the Wise|Okin]] admits he doesn't know the full effects of reuniting the artifacts but warns that the results could be catastrophic, potentially even apocalyptic.
- [[Okin the Wise|Okin]] informs the party of the presence of enemy forces within the city 
- #Quest [[Like Rats in a Cellar]]

Meanwhile in the city, news about impending doom have just arrived. A dwarven scout has just reached the stronghold and is asking an hearing to the king's counselor, High Warden of the [[Stonehelm clan]], [[Leon the Brave]]
