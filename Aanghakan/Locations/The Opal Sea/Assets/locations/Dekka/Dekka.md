Though the Green Sea's underbelly is gruesome, it's perilous waters are just the beginning of what [[the Opal Sea]] has to offer. Sail across the [[Swirling Strait]], and one finds the secluded island of [[Dekka]], once a Syndicate's paradise, now under the control of the Serpent's cult.

It's whispered that beneath Dekka's waves lie dungeons where captives undergo unspeakable torment, their pain harvested as a rare, illicit commodity.
