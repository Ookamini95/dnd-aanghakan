Here powerful currents may sway the ship to a perilous end, dense fog makes hard to see incoming threats and perilous navigation.

#Master-Notes 
One of these events may happen
- **Ghost Ship Encounter**: Through the mist appears a ghostly ship, barely visible and eerily silent. This spectral vessel could be a sign of bad omens, but confronting or boarding it could yield ancient maritime relics and artifacts. However, where there is risk there's a reward.
- **The Kraken's Grasp**: Suddenly, the waters around the ship churn violently as a giant tentacle surfaces, belonging to the legendary Kraken. This event tests the crew's ability to work together to fend off the beast. Victory against such a formidable foe would cement the crew's legend across the seas, while defeat could mean a watery grave.
- **Mysterious Fog**: As the ship sails through the dense fog, it stumbles upon a floating, abandoned vessel filled with valuable cargo but no sign of its crew. Investigating the ship could yield supplies and treasures, but there's also the risk that the fog conceals darker secrets waiting to be unleashed on unwary sailors.
