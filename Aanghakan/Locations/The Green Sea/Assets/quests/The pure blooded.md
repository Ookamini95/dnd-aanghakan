### **The Commandments of the Pure Blooded**

1. **Thou Shalt Seek the Blessing**: Embrace the gift of the abyssal serpent willingly, for in submission lies true power.

2. **Thou Shalt Not Reveal Our Secrets**: The sacred truths of our order are for the pure blooded alone. To share them with the uninitiated is to invite ruin.

3. **Thou Shalt Honor the Prophet**: In all things, the Prophet's word is law. His vision guides our path from darkness into the depths of enlightenment.

4. **Thou Shalt Bear the Pain with Reverence**: The agony of transformation is the serpent's kiss, a mark of favor. Endure it with pride, for through suffering, we are reborn.

5. **Thou Shalt Not Covet the Untouched**: Those free from the curse's embrace are not to be envied but pitied, for they walk the world blind to the serpent's wisdom.

6. **Thou Shalt Protect the Brood**: The pure blooded are kin, bound by the serpent's gift. To harm another is to harm oneself, and traitors shall be cast out.

7. **Thou Shalt Pursue the Unawakened**: Seek out those marked by destiny but not yet claimed by the curse. Guide them into the fold, that they might share in our blessing.

8. **Thou Shalt Offer Sacrifice**: The serpent's hunger is unending, and we are its faithful feeders. Blood for the blooded, flesh for the fleshless.

9. **Thou Shalt Not Fear Death**: To die in the serpent's service is to ascend. Our bodies are but vessels; our essence eternal in the abyss.

10. **Thou Shalt Revere the Curse**: It is our sanctuary, our strength. To question its value is to question the abyss itself. Faith shall be your fortress.
