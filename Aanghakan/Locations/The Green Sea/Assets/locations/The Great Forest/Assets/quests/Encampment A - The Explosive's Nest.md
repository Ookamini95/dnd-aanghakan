Makeshift barricades and watchtowers hastily constructed from dark timber and scavenged materials encircle a cluster of tents and storage areas. The air is thick with the acrid smell of explosives and burning wood. This encampment is primarily used for storing and preparing explosives, which are used by the cult to wreak havoc in the forest and defend their territories.

### Weak Points:

1. **Storage Tent**: The main storage tent, located at the heart of the encampment, contains barrels of gunpowder and other explosive materials. It’s heavily guarded, but its centralized location and the volatile contents make it a prime target for sabotage.
2. **Rear Entrance**: A lesser-guarded rear entrance intended for supply runs and quick exits. It can be an entry point for stealthy characters.
3. **Watchtower Blind Spots**: The watchtowers have blind spots, especially in areas where the dense forest canopy obscures vision. These spots can be exploited for a sneaky approach or escape.
4. **Explosive Handling Area**: A zone where explosives are prepared and primed. It's less guarded compared to the storage tent, as most cultists avoid lingering near active explosives.

### Enemies:

1. **Cultist Bomb-Makers**: Experts in explosive devices, these cultists are capable of setting traps and using grenades in combat. They are less armored, focusing more on speed and agility.
2. **Elite Guards**: Heavily armored guards patrol the encampment, especially around the storage tent. They are equipped with swords and crossbows.
3. **Alchemy Acolytes**: These cultists are responsible for concocting explosive mixtures and poisonous gases. They're not frontline fighters but can cause significant damage if not dealt with quickly.
4. **Lookouts**: Positioned in the watchtowers, these cultists are equipped with longbows and signal horns to alert the camp in case of an intrusion.


#Master-Notes 
- The encampment is a ticking bomb; a well-placed fire spell or a sneaky sabotage could set off a chain reaction of explosions.
- Stealth and reconnaissance should be encouraged. Rushing in without a plan could result in heavy casualties.
- Use of water or non-flammable spells could be a strategic way to handle the explosives without setting them off.
- Capturing a bomb-maker could provide valuable information or even an ally, as not all cultists might be wholly devoted to the Abyssal Serpent’s cause.
