The Armory Grove is an encampment known for its extensive collection of weapons. Wooden palisades, reinforced with iron spikes, form a formidable perimeter. Inside, rows of tents and weapon racks are guarded by diligent cultists. The sound of metal clanging and the occasional spark from a makeshift forge fill the air. This camp is a critical supply point for the cult's armed forces, storing everything from swords and shields to more exotic and magical weaponry.

### Weak Points:

1. **Makeshift Forge**: Located at one side of the encampment, the forge is where weapons are repaired and occasionally crafted. Itâ€™s often busy, but less guarded, providing an opportunity for sabotage or theft.
2. **Supply Tents**: Rows of tents contain stored weapons and armor. They are less secure than the main armory and can be a good target for hit-and-run tactics.
3. **Hidden Back Trail**: A barely visible trail leads to the back of the encampment, used mainly by scouts and hunters. This path provides a stealthy approach to the camp.
4. **Central Armory**: The heart of the encampment, containing the most valuable weapons, including enchanted items. Highly guarded but offers the greatest rewards.

### Enemies:

1. **Armored Cultists**: These cultists serve as the primary guards of the encampment, wearing heavy armor and wielding a variety of weapons.
2. **Weapon Masters**: Skilled in combat, these individuals are responsible for training new recruits and guarding the central armory. They are formidable opponents.
3. **Scouts and Hunters**: Lightly armored but quick, these cultists patrol the outskirts of the camp and are the first line of defense against intruders.
4. **Blacksmith Acolytes**: Found near the forge, these are more craftsmen than fighters, but they can be dangerous with the tools and hot metal at their disposal.


#Master-Notes:
- The encampment offers a mix of combat and stealth opportunities. Players can choose to sneak in for a specific target or engage in more direct combat.
- Disarming traps around weapon racks or dealing with guards silently can provide an edge in surprise.
- Negotiation or intimidation might be viable strategies, especially with the blacksmiths who might not be as ideologically driven as the cultists.
- Capturing a weapon master could lead to acquiring unique weapons or learning about other strategic locations in the forest.
