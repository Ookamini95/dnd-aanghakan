The once thriving treetop village, known as [[Aerilath's Rest]], has been abandoned amidst the encroaching darkness of the Abyssal Serpent's influence.

This enigmatic village, once a common location of now lies abandoned and shrouded in an eerie silence. The village's interconnected platforms and suspended houses, woven between the gnarled branches of towering ancient trees, speak of a forgotten era.

**Features of the Location:**

- **Suspended Structures:** Weathered wooden platforms and houses, connected by a network of rope bridges, some of which are frayed or broken, demanding careful navigation.
- **Abandoned Artifacts:** Scattered throughout the village are remnants of the past: faded tapestries, old hunting tools, and pottery, some with some light enchantments still lingering.
- **Secret Sanctuary:** A small hidden sanctuary inside the trunk of the enormous tree in the middle of the encampment, once a place of worship or meeting, now holds relics or ancient tomes that provide lore about the village and the forest.
- **Eerie Atmosphere:** A sense of being watched or followed, with occasional glimpses of shadowy figures that vanish upon second glances.

#Master-Notes  In the secret sanctuary, with a DC 10 perception check to find the small opening in the trunk, a small enchanted _(returning)_ throwable weapon will be available.

#Master-Notes The only remaining people are from the [[Tribal factions|Popori]] tribe, a young girl and her little sister, they have been watching the party since their arrival, but are clumsy and can be easily found out.

> **?????**: Please... please don't kill us...

Mathilde and Chloe, twin sisters from the Popori tribe, stand as the sole survivors of a harrowing encounter deep within the forest. Their tribe, caught in a desperate struggle, was overrun by an onslaught of aberrant creatures. It was a grim and chaotic battle, with the tribe's valiant efforts ultimately proving futile against the overwhelming tides of malevolent foes. The forest, once a haven, now echoes with the peril of frequent and often lethal patrols by these demonic entities.

#Master-Notes Now the responsibility of the Popori girls relies on the party, will they decide to escort the girls back? Tell them to hide and wait? Meanwhile a nearby patrol of enemies has detected their presence and is rapidly approaching.
