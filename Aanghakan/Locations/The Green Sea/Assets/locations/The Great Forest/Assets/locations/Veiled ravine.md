Revine with few accesses from the northern side. The town of [[Ymburg]] through the Mistwalker's gorge and the town of [[Esmeralda]] with the Silent man's pass.
If else fails, it is possible to pass through [[The Great Forest]] and walk the ravine to the other side.

#Master-Notes On the mountain side a discrete corridor has been built by the gnomes through the mountain side granting safe passage. Here only the weaker groups of enemies make regular patrols, mainly goblin archers and goblin riders.
