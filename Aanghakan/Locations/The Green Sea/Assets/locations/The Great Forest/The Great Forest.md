In the heart of a once tranquil forest, now shrouded in darkness and unease, the Abyssal Serpent's cult has woven a tapestry of terror. This forest, a labyrinth of ancient trees and shadowed paths, is a stark contrast to its former self, where peace and nature's gentle whispers reigned. Enemy encampments, like malignant growths, spread across the land, poised to strike at Thunderpeak, the distant, beleaguered capital.

The forest's creatures have been grotesquely transformed, twisted by dark magics, they now serve the Abyssal Serpent, their forms and minds warped beyond recognition. Suspended villages, once a network of safe havens amongst the treetops, now hang silent and desolate, or worse, teem with the serpent's minions.

For those daring to navigate this perilous realm, courage and wit must be their closest allies. The once clear paths are fraught with danger, and the air hums with the silent threat of ambush. Only the most cunning and resilient adventurers can hope to pass through unharmed, their journey an endless test of survival and guile.

#Master-Notes This is the most direct but the hardest path to Thunderpeak. If party decides to go for this path you should warn them of possible team wipes and harsh sacrifices. 

#Master-Notes Many groups of enemies patrol the forest and will trigger random encounters with the players. 

- Mutant animals: Hounds, Owlbears, Brown Bears, Giant spiders and Dire Wolves are just some of the morphed animals that independently or in small groups patrol the forest. These have usually keen senses and will snuff out any unsuspecting victim.
- Groups of cultists: Usually hanging around the main camps in the east part of the forest. These groups tend to be bigger, more organized and most importantly able to call upon close allied groups. Getting caught by these is practically a death sentence.
- Allied Forces of Darkness: The cult's camps harbor sinister and malevolent beings of considerable power. Night Hags, Manticores, and even some Liches have sworn loyalty to the Abyssal Serpent. This means that skeleton soldiers and corrupted forest spirits are part of the patrols.
