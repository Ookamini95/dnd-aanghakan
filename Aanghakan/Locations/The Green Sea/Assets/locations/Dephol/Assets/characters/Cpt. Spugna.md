Cadenza grew up on the deck of a ship, learning the language of the winds and the moods of the sea. The old pirate taught him the art of navigation, swordplay, and, most importantly, the power of music. With an elder violin, a powerful artifact salvaged from a shipwreck, Cadenza discovered his true calling. His music could calm storms, guide lost ships, and even charm the most fearsome creatures from the depths.

While Cadenza, with his merry crew and the tune of his violin, roamed the seas in pursuit of adventure and freedom, his fame inevitably attracted the envy and wrath of a powerful enemy, Lich Beard.

Faced with the relentless pursuit of powerful forces and the danger it posed to his crew and ship, Cadenza decided that the wisest course of action was to disappear from the spotlight, at least temporarily. Thus, he staged his own demise in a spectacularly orchestrated shipwreck, rumored to be caused by a monstrous sea creature. As the tales of his tragic end spread, Cadenza assumed the guise of a humble sailor named "Spugna."

#Master-Notes He's well versed in the art of trade, he's got a friend of a friend that can procure a ship... with a caveat: the cheapest is a shipwreck costs around 150 gold coins and needs some... maintenance.
