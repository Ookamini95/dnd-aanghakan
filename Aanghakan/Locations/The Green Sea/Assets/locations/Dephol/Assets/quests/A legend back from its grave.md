Rumors have been swirling around Dephol about ghostly ships seen off the coast, and strange, skeletal figures lurking in the shadows of the docks at night. The city is abuzz with fear and curiosity.

While in [[Dephol]], the players overhear a heated discussion at a local tavern. A group of frightened sailors are talking about their recent encounter with a ghostly ship manned by skeletal pirates. The sailors speak of a chilling figure leading the skeletons, a being they refer to as "one of the Skullies".
In particular a survivor is convinced that the legendary [[Tribal factions|Lich Beard]] is back to haunt the waters of the Opal Sea and rumors have spread that some of those Skullies are already amongst the population. Tension are high, and most trained personnel are terrorized to take to the sea.

#Master-Notes Some Skullies are in [[Dephol]] are tasked with the following tasks :

1. **Skullies' Secret Activities**: The Skullies, hidden among the populace or operating from secluded spots near the harbor, are quietly sabotaging ships, acquiring explosive materials, and planning a major strike on the harbor.
   
2. **City's Response**: The city authorities are increasingly concerned. Patrols are intensified, and some citizens form vigilante groups, but fear and uncertainty lead to paranoia and false accusations.

3. **Unfolding Developments**: If players don't intervene or investigate, the sabotage efforts gradually increase. Ships begin to sink, mysterious fires break out, and tension rises. The city's economy and safety are at stake.

Achieving the trust of enough people to leave bay will be considered sufficient to fulfil the quest requirements. 

Some events that may be useful to introduce the quest can be :

- Lost cargo : a ship as been sabotaged and the party are direct witnesses of the rising desperation of a merchant while he slowly realizes that the delicate content of the cargo ship is dispersed as the ship leaves bay. He will try to accuse the party, but naming [[Gill]] will be enough to end the pickle.
- Buyout of materials : it seems local alchemists are out of **Sulfur** and **Alchemical Fire**. An INT roll with DC 10 is enough to understand that someone is trying to make a bomb. If questioned, the merchant will also notice a sudden surge in demand of **Bat Guano** (fireball component). 
- Construction of barricades : locals have chosen resistance and are preparing for the possible invasion from the forces of the Cult. Starting from the second morning upon arrival, militia groups will start patrolling the city, and from the fourth day locals will start building barricades with sacks of sands to impede raids to the city. Skullies will inevitably come in touch with the locals and may resort to fighting or running, depending on the situation.
