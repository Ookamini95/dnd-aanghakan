[[The Green Sea]] is [[Red Star Syndicate]] main turf, and most proficuous business venture. Here [[Gustav Kozlov]], leader of the organization has established a sprawling underground network of illegal activities. From illicit trade in rare substances to underground fighting rings featuring exotic beasts from the world's edge, the Red Star Syndicate has its hand in every shade of vice, while always keeping a iron grip on power.

Yet, lurking in the shadows, the [[Cult of the Abyssal Serpent]] has been weaving its influence into the syndicate's fabric. Their insidious goal is to exploit the syndicate's vast connections, aiming to release the [[Abyssal Serpent]] from its ancient chains.

#Master-Notes Quest can be initiated during exploration:  

- A bloodied survivor: While exploring a bustling marketplace or the outskirts of [[Dephol]], the party is suddenly accosted by a ragged, bloodied individual. Showing signs of extreme malnutrition and desperation, he attempts to steal food from the party or nearby stalls.
- In the shady corners of [[Dephol]], perhaps in a dimly lit tavern or in the city's seedy underbelly, the party is approached by an informant. This individual, driven by various motivations - greed, fear, or vendetta against the syndicate - unveils tales of a sinister arena and the syndicate's intertwining fate with the Cult of the Abyssal Serpent.

Investigating the syndicate's territories, the party stumbles upon secret dark rituals, performed in the shadows of the city's underbelly, where members of the Red Star Syndicate are being initiated into the Cult of the Abyssal Serpent, swayed by promises of unparalleled power. 

Hidden deep within [[Dephol]], the underground arena is a hive of activity, although

#Master-Notes [[Gustav Kozlov]] is aware of the cult's presence in his ranks, and has been quietly observing it, while deciding on the best course of action. In case the party eradicates the cult in [[Dephol]], Gustav will be pleased and have a better opinion on the party when they first meet.
