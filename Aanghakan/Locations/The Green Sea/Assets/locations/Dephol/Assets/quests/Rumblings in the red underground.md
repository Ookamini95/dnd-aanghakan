[[The Green Sea]] is [[Red Star Syndicate]] main turf, and most proficuous business venture. Here [[Gustav Kozlov]], leader of the organization has established a sprawling underground network of illegal activities. From illicit trade in rare substances to underground fighting rings featuring exotic beasts from the world's edge, the Red Star Syndicate has its hand in every shade of vice, while always keeping a iron grip on power.

Yet, lurking in the shadows, the [[Cult of the Abyssal Serpent]] has been weaving its influence into the syndicate's fabric. Their insidious goal is to exploit the syndicate's vast connections, aiming to release the [[Abyssal Serpent]] from its ancient chains.

#Master-Notes Quest can be initiated during exploration:  

- A bloodied survivor: while exploring an emptied by the night marketplace or the outskirts of [[Dephol]], the party is suddenly accosted by a ragged, bloodied individual. Showing signs of extreme malnutrition and desperation, he attempts to steal scraps of food from the party. His mind is torn by the horrors he witnessed, but the message is clear : "The Serpent is among us, its fangs pierce the heart of Dephol, its venom bleeding us of hope. Beware, for it wears the faces we trust of". An huge red tattoo in the shape of a star can be found, a DC 10 History (or related) check will point out the origin of the man as a member of the [[Red Star Syndicate]]. After a while he dies by the [[The pure blooded|curse of the pure blooded]].
- A dark omen: a hung corpse appears at the entrance on the cemetery, its state almost decayed, with black blood protruding from the mouth onto its vests, cut in the shape of the [[Cult of the abyssal serpent|cult's]] symbol.

Investigating the syndicate's territories, the party may stumble upon a secret chamber, where dark rituals are performed in the shadows of the city's underbelly, and where lower ranking members of the Red Star Syndicate are being initiated into the Cult of the Abyssal Serpent, swayed by promises of unparalleled power and easy achievements. 


#Master-Notes [[Gustav Kozlov]] is aware of the cult's presence in his ranks, and has been quietly observing it, while deciding on the best course of action. In case the party eradicates the cult in [[Dephol]], Gustav will be pleased and have a better opinion on the party when they first meet.
