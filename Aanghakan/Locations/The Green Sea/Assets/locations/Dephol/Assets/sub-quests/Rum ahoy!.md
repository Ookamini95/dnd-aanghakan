Some events may trigger


- While in [[Dephol]], the players overhear a heated discussion at a local tavern. A group of frightened sailors are talking about their recent encounter with a ghostly ship manned by skeletal pirates. The sailors speak of a chilling figure leading the skeletons, a being they refer to as "one of the Skullies". In particular a survivor is convinced that the legendary [[Tribal factions|Lich Beard]] is back to haunt the waters of the Opal Sea and rumors have spread that some of those Skullies are already amongst the population.

- A large shipment of refined beverages just arrived at the harbor. A closer inspections of the barrels could spot **Rum**, **Whiskey** and even some dwarven **Fire Wine**. 

#Master-Notes An high enough perception may spot something weird about some of the barrels, covered in a glue-like goo and a DC 12 INT reveals it being nitroglycerin, clearly an attempt at sabotaging the harbor. Successfully disarming these nitroglycerin-laced barrels and saving the harbor will net the party some fame and notoriety.

- The party may find someone trying to buy explosive material like a saboteur and/or someone investigating the sabotages. 
- An attempt to a surprise attack the harbor could be made by skilled skeletal forces emerging from the mist of the bay on a full moon night, tasked to secure and destroy the bay, while escaping by sea. This assault tests the defenses the party helped to strengthen and serves as the initial engagement in the day's conflict.
