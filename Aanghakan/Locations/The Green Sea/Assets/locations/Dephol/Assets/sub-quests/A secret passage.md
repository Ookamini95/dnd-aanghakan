A secret passage to a den of the [[Red Star Syndicate]] is situated in the city's cemetery.

One of the tombstones have a secret lever to open a passage. This can be discovered by 

- Following either a cult member or a member of the syndicate, unnoticed. A simple quest to rescue a pet animal gone missing, or a quest to retrieve alchemical material (human bones) will suffice to have a pretext.
- Finishing an important quest near Dephol could lead to powerful insights on the intermingling of the dark forces of the cult with the weakest links of the syndicate, a clear attempt at infiltrating its forces and gain influence over the organization.
