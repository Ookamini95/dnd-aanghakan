Dephol is a sprawling harbor city, its landscape dominated by the vast, shimmering expanse of the sea on one side and dense, dark woods on the other. The city's architecture is a blend of old and new, where ancient, weather-beaten buildings with salt-stained walls stand alongside more modern, robust structures. Narrow cobblestone streets wind through the city, leading to the bustling harbor, which is the heart of Dephol's economy. Majestic ships dock at the extensive piers, and the air is filled with the mingled scents of salt, fish, and exotic spices from distant lands.

The harbor is a hive of activity. Fishermen, merchants, sailors, and dockworkers mingle in a chaotic ballet of daily commerce. Cranes hoist cargo from ships, while shouts and the creaking of ropes and wood punctuate the air. However, the recent events have cast a shadow over the harbor, with increased patrols and a noticeable tension among the workers.

Dephol's inhabitants reflect the many faces of those who come by sea, united from its hardships. Recent troubling events have caused a shift in their demeanor. Once warm and open to strangers, the locals now meet outsiders with a cold, suspicious gaze. Taverns and inns, once filled with loud conversations and laughter, now buzz with hushed tones and wary glances. The people of Dephol are proud of their maritime heritage, but the air of suspicion has led to a more guarded and cautious community.
