Ymburg is a town renowned for its prosperous trade. It's a hub for merchants from far and wide who come to barter and sell their wares. Ymburg is particularly known for its rare arboreal products such as special tree saps, rare woods, and herbs. The Ymburg market square is the heart of the city, always bustling with activity.

#Master-Notes The town is practically deserted, due to the news of the "Esmeralda incident" reaching fast. Most have left and what's left is for the takings. Groups of enemy goblin riders (2d4 +1) are approaching Ymburg.

#Master-Notes This town is a strategic route and enemy forces from [[The Great Fores]] will try to seize the location to have control over the [[Veiled ravine]].
