Beneath the ever-watchful gaze of the mountains, stretching out towards the horizon, lies the realm of tranquility and fertility known as the Green Sea. A blanket of verdant foliage stretches as far as the eye can see, punctuated by the constant rhythm of life that marks the passage of time.

This vast expanse of land, primarily used for cultivating life's necessities, is a testament to the toil and tenacity of the people. Humble homesteads dot the landscape, taming the wilderness, bringing forth abundance from the fertile soil. Herds of livestock graze peacefully, while fields of wheat, corn, and barley sway gently in the summer breeze. Life here is simple, shaped by the seasons and the weather, removed from the chaos and complexity of the world beyond.

At the heart of this bucolic idyll stands the proud city of the Council, [[Crestwood]], the hub of civilization amidst the agricultural sprawl. It is here that the [[Triumvirate of the Plains]] convenes, an elected council of wise and judicious souls, who administer the affairs of the region with measured grace. They balance the demands of nature and necessity, preserving the age-old traditions of their ancestors while navigating the tribulations of the present.

Despite the serene facade, the Green Sea is not without its perils. Human ambition and greed have carved their own path through this Eden, from bands of brigands that lurk on the outskirts of the well-trodden roads, to the rising tide of lawlessness within [[Crestwood]] itself. While the Triumvirate administers justice with a firm hand, the swell of criminality threatens to engulf the peace they've so meticulously nurtured.

And from the shadows of the mountains and the depths of the woods, other dangers encroach. Raids from the audacious mountain goblins disturb the otherwise placid life, a grim reminder of the primal wilderness that borders this sea of green. Beasts emerge from the forest's edge, driven by hunger and instinct, adding another layer of trepidation to the hardworking lives of the people.

Administered by the steadfast [[Stonehelm Clan]] from the majestic [[Thunderpeak]], and guided by the wisdom of the Triumvirate, it stands as an emblem of humanity's persistence, a testament to our tenacity in the face of adversity. It is here, amidst the pastoral fields and beneath the azure sky, that life unfurls in all its complex simplicity.
