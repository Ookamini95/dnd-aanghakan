The tale of our heroes is paused amidst their desperate need for an escape from the ongoing carnage. Surveying the scene, it's clear that most of the carriages have been reduced to debris. An all-too-familiar voice rings out from nearby:

> *Merchant:* Damn it, move it damn animal. 
> *Dwarven Ox*: (*stubborn animal noises*) 
  
The previously encountered merchant appears to be in quite a predicament. One of the wheels of his carriage has shattered, making it difficult to move.
With a grimace, the merchant wipes his brow, glancing at the chaos engulfing the area. His gaze lands on the party, and his eyes light up.

> *Merchant:* Oi, you there! Lend a hand, will you? We could get out of here with this carriage if I can just get it moving!

#Master-Notes 
While leaving Serene behind is perfectly good ending, this campaign tries to last longer than that, and the [[Gill|merchant]] should be the npc you should use to persuade the players to take in Serene. This note has been left as a joke but also as a reminder for myself about making a possible fork to the story if a good idea comes up. 

____________________

As the players make their departure, they can cast a final glance over their shoulders at the town now consumed in flames. Ashes ascend towards the heavens, coalescing into the ominous form of a serpent in the sky. The merchant, his gaze firmly fixed the dimly lighted road, introduces himself as [[Gill]], a man in service to the esteemed [[Stonehelm clan]]. His task was to retrieve a shipment of high quality goods ordered by [[Thenerifa]], Stonehelm Clan Forge master, for a present for the [[Mell|king's newborn daughter]]. This was supposed to be an easy task, not much unlike a paid vacation... instead he'll be the harbinger of dire news.

[[Gill]] intends to travel throughout the coming night, allowing the party to recover their strength. By dawn, hoping to have put enough distance between them and the horrors of the last night, he will ask one of the players to swap places in order to rest, while giving instructions on how to reach their next destination, [[Luxemburg]], a small commercial city near the coastal line. From there it should be possible to contact his headmaster and decide what to do.

#Master-Notes Here a couple of different scenarios can unfold. Below I've provided a couple of examples.

- __The party is reached by 1d4+1 mutant hounds:__ As the players continue their journey, they hear the distant howl of beasts. They could try to outrun them, hide, or prepare for battle. Depending on the roll, they might face up to five mutant hounds, each mutated in strange and horrifying ways, a living testament to the catastrophe that happened in the town.

- __The party encounters a group of merchants headed for the festival:__ this one is more of a social encounter. As the dawn's light paints the sky in shades of red and orange, a merry group of merchants comes into view. They're on their way to the festival, unaware of the town's fate. The party could choose to warn them, withhold information, or extract what they can from these merchants in terms of goods or information. 
  
- __A small family of refugees crosses their path, asking for aid or information:__ the refugees are a family of farmers who barely escaped the disaster at the town. They're hungry, frightened, and desperate for help. The party could choose to aid them with food, protection, or information.

___________

#Master-Notes  [[Duxemburg]] is a #cLocation and for such it can be modified without fear of damaging the coherence of the story. Here some possible scenarios :

- the city, usually bustling with activity, has been mostly evacuated due to information passed down by the survivors. The party meets a group of guards that will help them get the necessary tools and information to continue the journey.
- the city is bustling with activity as usual, the party may find any information at the local merchant's guild, tools and rations at the local market
- the city is deserted, an eerie silence filling the streets. It's clear something terrible happened here. The party has the opportunity to investigate and discover what happened, potentially unearthing new clues or even a short quest line.
- the city has fallen victim to a deadly plague. The party can choose to help, avoid the city altogether, or look for the source of the plague, perhaps finding a cure.

In the meanwhile, Serene has just regained senses, her eyes lost on the magnificence of the [[The Green Sea]], whilst listening to the refreshing spring noises coming from the countryside. Although the idyllic frame, she's clearly deep in her thoughts, and not really in the mood for talking. 

#Master-Notes Serene, while possessed, has spoken with the deity, and is aware of her father's death. She responds in monosyllables, not in the mood for conversations. Below I've provided her character sheet.

After reaching the city, [[Gill]] manages to contact [[Thenerifa]], informing her about what unfolded the previous day. After a seemingly endless conversation between the two held in dwarvish, the merchant returns to the party to comunicate his intention to reach the capital as soon as possible, while answering any questions about the travel the party may have.

#Master-Notes The journey to the capital lasts about 2 weeks and you are free to pick and choose locations and encounters for the players from the [[The Green Sea]],
