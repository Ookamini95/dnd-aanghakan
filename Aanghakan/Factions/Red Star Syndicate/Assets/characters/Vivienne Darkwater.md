Known as the "Beastmaster of the Green Sea," Vivienne oversees the midnight auctions. She has an uncanny ability to control and manipulate the fearsome creatures from the forbidden woods, making her a key player in the Syndicate's gruesome entertainments.

Born into a family of esteemed merchants, Vivienne's childhood was steeped in the allure of rare and mystical creatures. However, a dramatic turn of fortune cast her family from their high societal perch, thrusting Vivienne into a world far removed from her privileged upbringing. Amid the grit and survival of street life, her early fascination with exotic beasts transformed into a burning obsession.

Undeterred by her family's downfall, Vivienne used her innate cunning and street-smart adaptability to weave a new web of influence. She meticulously built an underground network, trading in the extraordinary and the forbidden. Her efforts single-handedly reignited the market for exotic materials and creatures thought to be long extinct, establishing her as a formidable figure in the shadowy corners of commerce.

Vivienne's first encounter with [[Gustav Kozlov]] was a stark lesson in power dynamics, more an aggressive annexation of her business than a partnership. Yet, this setback did little to dampen her spirit. Vivienne remains resolute, driven by her singular desire to immerse herself in the world of mystical beasts and rare artifacts, undeterred by the challenges that lie in her path.
