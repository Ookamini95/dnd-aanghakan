The Green Sea, a region of tranquil beauty, has become the thriving epicenter of the Red Star Syndicate's darkest dealings. While the area is their main turf, their tendrils of influence and horror stretch much further.

The Syndicate's operations in the Green Sea are particularly gory. Midnight auctions sell rare, blood-curdling beasts dragged from the depths of the forbidden woods. Hidden arenas pit desperate souls against each other, where the floor is frequently stained with the crimson of its fallen combatants and the air is thick with screams of despair.

Though the Green Sea's underbelly is gruesome, it's just the beginning. Sail across the Opal Sea, and one finds the secluded island of [[Dekka]], a Syndicate's paradise. Here, forbidden rituals that defy nature and decency take place. Shadowy figures pay exorbitant sums for concoctions brewed from the tortured souls of the damned. It's whispered that beneath Dekka's waves lie dungeons where captives undergo unspeakable torment, their pain harvested as a rare, illicit commodity.

In [[Thunderpeak]], the capital of Erebor, the Syndicate works more discreetly but no less insidiously. The proud Stonehelm Clan turns a blind eye, not by choice, but due to the Syndicate's intricate web of blackmail. Key members of the clan are entrapped in compromising positions, their honor and reputations held at knife-point, making direct action against the Syndicate a dangerous game.

Moving further afield to The East O'lands, the elvish region, the Syndicate deals in rarer, more exotic vices. Here, they trade in memories, extracting and bottling the most profound elvish experiences to be consumed by the highest bidders. The age-old wisdom of the elves, their joys, sorrows, and deepest fears, are traded like common wine in Syndicate-run black markets.

Lastly, in the exotic lands of Regnai, the Syndicate has established a stranglehold over the spice routes. But these are not ordinary spices; these are mind-altering, hallucinogenic substances that can bend reality, granting visions of heaven or hell, depending on the dose.

At the helm of this sprawling empire of horror stands Gustav Kozlov, a man whose cunning is matched only by his ruthlessness. However, his reign is vast, his operations many. And as with any ruler, his story and influence warrant its own dedicated chronicle.
