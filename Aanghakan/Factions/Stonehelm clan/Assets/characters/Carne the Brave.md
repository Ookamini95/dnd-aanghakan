High Warden of the [[Stonehelm clan]], hero of the crowds.

Carne, born into the esteemed Stonehelm clan, grew up in the shadow of his brother Balin, who was naturally inclined towards leadership and strategy. Unlike Balin, Carne was drawn to the more physical and direct aspects of combat. From a young age, he exhibited exceptional prowess in battle, showing a keen understanding of weaponcraft and a natural talent for warfare.

As brothers, Carne and Balin were a formidable pair. While Balin strategized and led, Carne was at the forefront of the battlefield, wielding his axe with fearsome efficiency. His strength and courage were unmatched, earning him a reputation as one of Thunderpeak's most formidable warriors.

The defining moment in Carne's life came during a critical battle against the orcish hordes that threatened Thunderpeak. In the heat of this battle, Balin was cornered and about to receive a mortal blow. Carne, witnessing his brother in peril, charged through the enemy lines with a ferocious intensity. He fought with such valor and skill that he not only saved his brother but also turned the tide of the battle. In the course of this heroic act, Carne sustained a grievous wound. Despite the pain and danger to his own life, he managed to save Balin, demonstrating an extraordinary level of bravery and self-sacrifice. This act of bravery not only saved Balin's life but also solidified Carne's legend among the dwarves of Thunderpeak.

Despite his heroics, Carne remained humble and never sought glory or leadership. He was content being the shield to his brother's spear. His loyalty to Balin and to Thunderpeak was unwavering, and he continued to serve as a key figure in many more battles, always fighting bravely and with honor.

After the battle, Carne's exploits became the stuff of legend. Young dwarves would speak of his bravery and his unbreakable bond with his brother. Yet, Carne never let this fame change him. He remained grounded, always prioritizing the safety and prosperity of his home over personal accolades.

Later in his life, Carne took it upon himself to train the younger generation of warriors in Thunderpeak. He passed on his skills and values, emphasizing bravery, loyalty, and humility. Through his teachings, he ensures that the spirit of Thunderpeak's warriors would endure, long after his time.
