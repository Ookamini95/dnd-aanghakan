1. **Eldon Fairweather**: The first of the Triumvirate, Eldon is a man whose roots are as deep in the soil of the Green Sea as the ancient oaks themselves. A former farmer and a sage of the land, his intimate knowledge of agriculture and his deep connection with the earth guide his decisions. His hands, though now more often found gripping scrolls and decrees, still bear the calluses of hard work, symbolizing his dedication and hard-earned wisdom. Eldon is the voice of the farmers, the protector of the harvests, and the preserver of the land's natural bounty.

2. **Lady Mira Stonevale**: As a noble from a lineage as old as Crestwood itself, Lady Mira brings a sense of tradition and dignity to the Triumvirate. Her family's history is interwoven with the Green Sea's past, and she carries this legacy with a mix of pride and solemn responsibility. With a keen intellect and a sharp tongue, Mira is often the mediator within the Triumvirate, balancing the old ways with the needs of the present. Her diplomatic skills are invaluable, especially in dealings with Thunderpeak and the Stonehelm Clan, navigating the intricate web of politics with grace and poise.

3. **Bran Stonecrest**: The most enigmatic member of the Triumvirate, Bran, hails from beyond the boundaries of the Green Sea. Once a traveler and a scholar, his journeys have taken him to distant lands and brought him back with a wealth of knowledge and a broader perspective. Bran is the voice of progress and adaptation, often pushing for changes that would better equip the Green Sea to face modern challenges. His experiences with different cultures and his understanding of the wider world provide a crucial counterbalance to the traditional views of his fellow council members.


Together, these three rulers form a council that is as dynamic as it is steadfast. Eldon's grounded wisdom, Mira's noble insight, and Bran's progressive outlook converge to create a governance that is both respectful of its past and mindful of its future. They stand united in their love for the Green Sea, each bringing their unique strengths to bear in the stewardship of this land of tranquil beauty and hidden perils. Their reign, marked by both harmony and tension, is a testament to the complexities of leadership in a land caught between the serenity of tradition and the whispers of change.
