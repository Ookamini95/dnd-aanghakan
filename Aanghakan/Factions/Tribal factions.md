Various races in [[Aanghakan]] live in secluded villages, or are inherently nomad in nature, but all tend to form small groups and factions.


- The Popori : a race of descent from both the mountain halflings and the earth gnomes, these people of nomads navigate amongst the most treacherous terrains and are capable guides. The Popori are simple people who worship the Earth Mother and speak a mix of old dwarven and common. It's not unusual for castaways from the Popori tribe to employ themselves as expert guides.
