Description -

A secretive and sinister cult that worships a dark and powerful serpent deity. 

>The cult's members believe that obtaining the Heart of the Mountain will grant them the power to bring their god into the mortal world, and they are willing to do anything to achieve their goal. Their forces are composed of cultists, summoned fiends, and serpentine monsters.


## Sub factions : 

- The Scaled Shield

>The Scaled Shield serves as the martial arm of the Cult of the Abyssal Serpent. Their members are experts in combat, drilled to perfection in the brutal arts of war and defense. Trained by [[Broum the Unbreakable]], a being as tough as the ancient mountain rocks themselves, these fighters are skilled at using serpentine war tactics, relying on their resilience and tenacity to see them through any fight. They are the front line and often the public face of the cult, protecting its interests from overt threats. 

- Serpent's Whisper

The Serpent's Whisper specializes in espionage, intelligence gathering, and assassination. Headed by [[Llig the Deceiver]], they move silently through the shadows, their presence only ever felt too late. Skilled in the arts of deception, manipulation, and stealth, they twist the course of events subtly in favor of the cult. Their members, much like their leader, are experts in disguise and infiltration, using their abilities to shapeshift into different forms to penetrate even the most fortified places undetected.

- Echoes of the Serpent

The Echoes of the Serpent is a collective of prophets, seers, and diviners who interpret the will of the serpent deity and guide the Cult accordingly. With their intense connection to the [[Abyssal Serpent]], they experience visions and prophecies that they interpret to guide the cult's path. They play a crucial role in planning and decision-making within the Cult, setting the course for the future and often having the final say in major decisions.

- Fangs of the Deep

The Fangs of the Deep are the arcane heart of the Cult of the Abyssal Serpent, made up of arcane practitioners who blur the line between the earthly realm and the abyss. The Fangs are the ones responsible for the summoning of serpentine beasts and otherworldly fiends, calling them forth from the [[Dark Depths]] to do the Cult's bidding. They also consist of researchers and archivists who study ancient and forbidden texts in pursuit of more power for their deity. Their goal is not just to prepare for their god's arrival, but to ensure that when it does arrive, it will have the necessary power and influence to reign supreme. Fearlessly skirting the edges of forbidden knowledge, the Fangs of the Deep harness the eldritch magic of their abyssal patron to further the Cult's ends.
