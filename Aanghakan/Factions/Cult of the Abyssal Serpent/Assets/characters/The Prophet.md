Cloaked in enigma, this formidable individual rose from the ranks to seize control of the cult, transforming it into an entity far more formidable than it ever was. With a mind as sharp as a serpent's fang and a will as unyielding as iron, the Prophet's singular vision guides the cult's sinister agenda.

#Master-Notes The Prophet's plan is to rebuild the Thousand Roots Crown, an ancient and powerful artifact. By doing this, he aims to summon the abyssal serpent deity into the mortal world, elevating the Cult of the Serpent to unprecedented power. 

First born from a poor family in [[Dekka]], his mind as sharp as a knife as soon as out of the womb. Quickly gained influence over local criminal groups, molding their minds as fresh clay and growing the first roots of his own personal cult. Behind the exceptional individual that the Prophet was, you could see a dark desire to acquire power beyond comprehension, it was only a matter of time before he would try to achieve it whatever means necessary. 

It was Fate that made him find some old notes from [[Lord Cantrocas|the descendant of an absolute being]],
which spoke about the truth on what happened the day that the [[Abyssal Serpent]] serpent was sealed, on how the [[Thousand Roots Crown|crown]] gave the power to a mortal to defeat a godly being.

Thus, ascension was possible and within grasp.

This newfound wisdom also provided the Prophet with a technological advantage, allowing him to dominate the black market and secure a relentless influx of wealth. With a clear goal and the resources to achieve it, the Prophet now stands on the brink of unleashing chaos upon [[Aanghakan]].

#Master-Notes The prophet had no way to know that its existence was one created, made to play a role. A very skilled and useful puppet, but a puppet nonetheless.
