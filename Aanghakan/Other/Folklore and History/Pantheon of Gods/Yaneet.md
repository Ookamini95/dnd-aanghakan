Before the duality of night and day, before the discernment of light and shadow, there existed two cosmic entities - [[Elune]] and Yaneet. While Elune, the bright star of the cosmos, was celebrated and revered by many, her sister Yaneet remains known solely in some towns in the most remote parts of the [[The Green Sea|green sea]].

Yaneet, often referred to as the *Veiled Luminary*, represents transition - the dusks and dawns, the eclipses, and the shimmering horizons where day meets night, the delicate change of seasons.

**Cult Practices**:

Where Elune is openly revered, the cult of Yaneet is more discreet. Its followers gather during times of cosmic transition - during solar and lunar eclipses, solstices, and equinoxes. They believe these moments hold the power of transformation, where old can turn to new and destinies can be reshaped.

In their rituals, they adorn themselves in cloaks shimmering with hues of purple, gold, and indigo, representing the blending of day and night. In the more quaint towns situated along the shores of the Green Sea, particularly in the south, the cult practices of Yaneet have been adapted into softer, more community-oriented festivities. These festivals, inspired by the reverence for Yaneet, are woven seamlessly into the traditions and lifestyles of the local people. 

**Personality**:

Yaneet is introspective and values balance and transition, teaching her followers the beauty and power in fleeting moments and change. While Elune radiates robustly, Yaneet's presence is subtle yet profound. The bond between them is one dictated by destiny, maintaining cosmic equilibrium, intertwining the fates of the mortal in an eternal chaotic dance.
