Before the duality of night and day, before the discernment of light and shadow, there existed two cosmic entities - [[Elune]] and Yaneet. While Elune, the bright star of the cosmos, was celebrated and revered by many, her sister Yaneet remains known solely in some towns in the southern part of the [[The Green Sea|green sea]].

Yaneet, often referred to as the "Veiled Luminary", represents the transition phases of the universe - the dusks and dawns, the eclipses, and the shimmering horizons where day meets night. Her domain isn't just the twilight but the in-betweens, the moments of change, and the thresholds that mark transitions in life.

**Cult Practices**:

Where Elune is openly revered, the cult of Yaneet is more discreet. Its followers gather during times of cosmic transition - during solar and lunar eclipses, solstices, and equinoxes. They believe these moments hold the power of transformation, where old can turn to new and destinies can be reshaped.

In their rituals, they adorn themselves in cloaks shimmering with hues of purple, gold, and indigo, representing the blending of day and night. They light incense that produces a silvery smoke, believed to be reminiscent of Yaneet's ethereal presence. Songs sung in her honor capture the fleeting beauty of moments in-between, of change, and of the delicate balance she maintains in the cosmos.

**Personality**:

Yaneet is contemplative and introspective. While Elune's presence is robust and radiant, Yaneet's is gentle, subtle, yet profound. She values balance, harmony, and transition, teaching her followers to embrace change, to seek beauty in fleeting moments, and to recognize the power and potential in thresholds and transitions.

Elune and Yaneet, though contrasting in many ways, are inseparable. They function in harmony, ensuring the balance of the cosmos. Legends speak of their bond, which is stronger than any cosmic force. Together, they weave the tapestry of day and night, ensuring neither overshadows the other.
