[[Elune]]'s Chosen are not mere mortals but paragons of virtue and strength, anointed by the divine hand to stand against the rising tide of darkness. They are Elune's beacons in this realm, her champions of justice. [[Aein]], [[Thein]], [[Yaohwan]] â€“ each with their tales etched into the annals of time, bearing the mantle of their divine burden, shepherding the world through its darkest hours.
