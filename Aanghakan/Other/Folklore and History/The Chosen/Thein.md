Thein, the second of the Chosen, is a legend wrought from the wilderness, his soul untarnished and as pure as a still mountain lake. Born amongst wolves, he became a symbol of unyielding courage and fortitude. The Bearer of the [[Thousand Roots Crown]], Thein's destiny was a tale of celestial duty and mortal courage against the suffocating darkness brought forth by the [[Abyssal Serpent]].
