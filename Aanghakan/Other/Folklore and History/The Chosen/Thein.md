In the shadowed epochs before our time, Thein, the second of the Chosen, rose from the rugged embrace of the untamed wilds. His spirit shimmered, untouched by the maladies of time, pure as the crystalline waters of a secluded mountain lake that reflects nothing but the heavens. This legend was born amidst the fierce and loyal wolves, imparting upon him an aura of raw, unyielding strength. These majestic beasts didn't merely raise him; they embedded within him a fierce code — the primal laws of survival in a world unbroken.

Yet, it was a burning, relentless curiosity, a flame that could not be doused, which propelled him deeper into the very core of the ancient and whispering forest. A realm where towering trees, their bark etched with tales of yore, formed a complex labyrinth beneath a canopy that filtered only fragments of the sun's golden rays.

It was here, amidst the hallowed groves and the aromatic scent of ageless ferns, that Thein encountered the enigmatic elves. They weren't mere forest dwellers. Their aura pulsated with the weight of centuries, their eyes holding stories of epochs gone by. Their elegance in motion was juxtaposed with a razor-sharp alertness, a testament to eons spent in the heart of a forest teeming with veiled threats and wonders. From the shadows, Thein, with his wolf-enhanced senses, would observe, absorbing their refined skills and unmatched craftsmanship. His innate genius allowed him to mirror even their most intricate of tasks after just a fleeting glimpse.

Amongst these elves was [[Crastanco]], a figure of almost mythical stature, whose artistry was spoken of in hushed, reverent tones even amongst his kin. Sensing an unbridled potential within Thein, the sage-like elf took it upon himself to mentor the boy who had been sculpted by the wilderness. Their training was nothing short of epic. Crastanco, with an unwavering dedication, forged Thein's raw talents into refined masterpieces, teaching him to blend the raw force of nature with the finesse of craftsmanship. When Thein finally emerged, he was no longer the feral child of legend but a maestro whose creations thrummed with the very heartbeat of the forest.

Crowned with the ethereal [[Thousand Roots Crown]], Thein was now destined for a saga that spanned both the celestial realms and the earthly domain. A tale of valor, where he stood as the beacon of hope against the encroaching shadows cast by the formidable [[Abyssal Serpent]]. This is the story of Thein, a tale where cool isn’t just a vibe, but a legacy.
