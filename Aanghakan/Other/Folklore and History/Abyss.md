Hidden beneath the layers of known reality lies the Abyss, a yawning chasm that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Its existence is a testament to the power and repercussions of an ancient magic, and it stands as an eternal scar on the canvas of existence.

Legends speak of a tumultuous time, of an ascendant god that, driven by ambition and reckless rage, tore a gaping hole in the fabric of reality to quench his ego. This catastrophic rupture is now known as the Abyss and it is said to be related to the origin of the [[The ancient Gods|ancient gods]].

For those who can peer into the [[Astral Cosmos]], the Abyss appears as a swirling vortex of inky whiteness, surrounded by shimmering threads of black light representing the interconnected dimensions. 

Researchers and scholars from all corners of existence have postulated theories about the Abyss. Some believe it to be a portal to realms beyond comprehension, while others see it as a living entity, hungry and waiting. There are even those who whisper that the Abyss is the heart of the universe itself, a primal force that both predates and will outlast all things.
