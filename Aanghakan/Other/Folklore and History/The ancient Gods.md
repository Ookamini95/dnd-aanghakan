Long before the [[Age of the Heroes|age of heroes]], myths narrate the beginning of this universe as a tale of **blood** and **sacrifice**. The ancient god known as Eon, the keeper of cycles, master of **life** and **rebirth**, was said to be on the run from a being of unparalleled malevolence, an entity whose very name sent tremors through the foundation of the cosmos. Legends whispered that this relentless pursuer had transcended realms and bent even the most obstinate of fates in his quest for dominion. Some say he was an old adversary of Eon from a world long forgotten, one where the very fabric of existence had been torn asunder by their duels.

Eon, in a move born of both desperation and strategy, fashioned the world of [[Aanghakan]]. This wasn't a realm nurtured for life, but rather a cosmic bubble, a shimmering mirage adrift in the vast sea of existence.

But the land alone wouldn't suffice. To truly elude this horror's gaze, Eon had to disperse his essence, dilute his presence. And so, from his very core, echoes of his essence, he birthed the gods as myriad reflections, countless facets that would confound any who sought the true Eon amidst them. The land and its guardians stood intertwined, a testament to a masterful play in the endless game of cosmic hide and seek.

These entities, known as the ancient gods, act as a bulwark against **malevolent forces** that may intrude and disrupt the delicate **harmony** Eon so meticulously crafted, a parting gift to the denizens of [[Aanghakan]].

The known ancient gods are revered and adored, each by their own people. The cult to [[Elune]], (bright star of the cosmos), constitutes the principal religion of the [[Erebor]], as its inhabitants, being the closest to the history of [[The Chosen|the chosens]], are the torchbearers of these ancient tales, weaving them into their daily lives as reminders of a time when heroes rose against unsurmountable adversities.

The cult to **[[Lirael]]**, goddess of the tides and moon, is the most practiced in the islands. Islanders celebrate her through moonlit dances on the shores, sending out lanterns on the waves, and sculpting intricate moon-shaped amulets. Their society, intertwined with the ebb and flow of tides, has evolved around the teachings of Lirael, placing emphasis on cyclical rebirth, resilience, and the balance between land and sea.

The cult to **[[Mohen]]**, guardian of the sands and mirages, is the most practiced in the desert. Desert folk show devotion by building enormous sun dials and hosting festivals at every solstice. Their society, harshly shaped by the unforgiving sands, revolves around the virtues of survival, endurance, and the mysteries hidden beneath the dunes.

Lesser known cults are those practiced in secluded forests, atop towering peaks, or in shadowy caverns. These sects often worship deities of a more enigmatic or sinister nature, from the elusive **[[Fenral]]**, the spirit of whispers in the woods, to the dread **[[Moros]]**, the god of eternal night. 

In the vast tapestry of belief that weaves across [[Aanghakan]], these practices, though perhaps enigmatic to outsiders, remain an irreplaceable thread in its intricate design.
