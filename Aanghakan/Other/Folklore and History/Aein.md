In the grand tapestry of legends, the name Aein resounds with the echo of ancient victories, the mighty and revered Curator of Souls. Born of [[Giants]], he was the first of [[Elune|Elune's]] [[The Chosen|Chosen]]. His epic tale recounts a timeless battle against the ferocious Goor, the Orc king, and his armies of chaos. Aein, a mountain among men, a beacon amidst despair, stood undeterred, his resolve an unwavering, testament to the might of [[Elune|Elune's]] [[The Chosen|Chosen]].

The Curator of Souls was not just a designation but a divine vocation. In the religion of Elune, souls were considered sacred entities, journeys in themselves that needed guidance and protection. It was believed that upon death, a soul would wander, adrift in the cosmos, yearning for solace and illumination.

Aein, as the Curator, served as this guide, the beacon in the void. His connection with Elune granted him the spiritual sensitivity to perceive these wandering souls, and the wisdom to guide them towards their destined paths. It was his duty, his calling, to ensure that each soul found its sanctuary in the cosmic scheme, providing a bridge between the mortal coil and the spiritual realm, a shepherd for the departed, guiding the lost towards their cosmic destiny.
