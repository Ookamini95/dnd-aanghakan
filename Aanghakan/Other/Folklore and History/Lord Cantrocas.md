An erudite of the myths can pull out numerous curiosity from the list of the most powerful entities that walked the lands of Aanghakan in his known history, but an even odder creature of outstanding power has entered this realm in the recent time.

## The other world
During his mortal life Cantrocas used to be an ordinary individual in his own world, in his own universe. Little is known of this different plan of existence if not that the people of his race were called *half elves* and a few Gods used to rule and bend the reality and the mortal creatures to their will. Cyclic ages of war, despair and rebuild forged brave and strong races and spectacular individuals amongst them raised as hero to break the constant and selfish war schemed by the Gods. 

## The beginning
But this is not the world Cantrocas was born in. Thousands of years after the Age of the Heros, Cantrocas was born from the love of an elf adventurer and a human bride, unhappy of her dull existence as the wife of a farmer. Of course this is not a very interesting story, but it lead the young Cantrocas on a path of ambition fueled by cruelty and a total lack of empathy.

The key part of his ascension to God and Immortal creature is the meeting of a disjointed, undisciplined and absolutely gullible adventurer during one of his journey. This people, called by Cantrocas ***his party***, proved themselves capable of incredible challenges, given their scarse experience and equipment. In few years of adventures and questing their renown and prestige raised quickly enough to gain the  long forgotten and very powerful appellative of **Heroes**.


## The Ascension
But the souls of those heroes were very different from the ones that forged that lang lasting age of peace and the Gods, defeated but not destroyed, were looking keenly the growth of the self proclaimed **Lord Cantrocas**. His very birth was part of their plan and the path of power he was walking were built centuries before his own father met the mother of the pour half elf.

Blinded by his own ambition and sudden growth of power, Lord Cantrocas exploited his own companion to ascend from his mortal form, entering the forgotten realm of the Gods and gaining the status of Eternal. The ancient God known as **The Blind Precentor** master of **Fate** was slain by Lord Cantrocas and the enslaved souls of his former companions and his power stolen from the half elf in the process.

Blessed by his new power Lord Cantrocas saw his future, his fate, and also get to know the reason of his very existence. He war just a tool in the hands of the sealed Gods, an instrument vowed to free his masters, but his Ego grew beyond measures, turning the event in an explicable future even for the master of fate itself. 

## The Exile
In an unpredicted turn of the events, Lord Cantrocas called all the powers available to do the only thing he could to step out of the path the Gods plotted for him. Incapable of accepting that he was played by a superior power, with just the illusion of being a free willing individual, he did the unspeakable casting the most powerful spell in the history of all the universe on himself.
The spell shattered the now Eternal soul of Lord Cantrocas, sending one infinitely small fragment in each possible universe, pieces of reality unknown even to the Gods themselves.

Incapable of dyeing, the soul fragments reincarnated in new inhabitants of this new realms. Each piece contain only an extremely small spark of the original power of Lord Cantrocas, but retain all the memories of the former mortal he used to be. Everything happened since the day he was born the first time to the day he opened the gate to the realm of the Gods, all the nefariousness acts, the infamous conduct of his past life, still lives in the infinite replicas of Lord Cantrocas.

Lord Cantrocas doesn't really know what happened to him, but a strong link between each one of his replica exists, driving the infinite and clueless lords to seek for each other. His own ambition and ego makes impossible too cooperate and lead the poor soul to fall in an infinite fight between his infinite fragments.

Each time a Lord Cantrocas is born in an universe the same path of selfdetruction begin. First he seeks for power, in any way possible, usually exploiting strong individuals met in his journey. Then he find a way to reach a fragment of his soul. A fight begin between the two Lord Cantrocas, a fight where only one part will last, absorbing the power and the knowledge of the other one.

When a Lord Cantrocas get enough power and knoledge to invade other universes he start to collect numerous fragments until he meets another powerful Lord Cantrocas. During a fight between two powerful enough Lord Cantrocas the soul of the loser shatters again in an attempt to get free from the opponent, starting this infinite cycle again.

# The Lord Cantrocas
In this universe the corrupting touch of Lord Cantrocas started eons ago. During his first reincarnation on Aanghakan Lord Cantrocas managed to constraint numerous fragment of his soul inside the four gems the will became to be known as the gems of [[The ancient Gods]] used  to forge and power the [[Thousand Roots]] by [[Thein]] in a future age.

A crown set with those gems was used by a Lord Cantrocast to best powerful replicas of himself without actually became one with the other selves, in a futile attempt to escape the regrettable fate casted by himself ages ago in a different reality.

Left without the possibility to ever escape his fate, the previous Lord Cantrocas of this universe faced his inevitable defeat in the end and the precious jewels that used to adorn his crown were sealed in the deep of the hearth by his last attempt to stop another Lord to steal the power gathered in a lifetime of unmerciful and infamous acts.

The gems, buried underground ended up fueling the power of the ancient gods in ways regrettably lost deeply in time. When they were first unburied and gifted to [[Thein]] their origin was already sealed in the oblivion of the mortal knowledge by the power of the gem itself, in the attempt to never be founded by another Lord Cantrocas, a danger to the very existence of the gems themselves that in time became sentient entities.

But the Fate of a Lord is to be entangled in his own tragedy and so forth, the new Lord Cantrocas feel the inexplicable link that connect himmself to the very power that hold the balance of the world. His cruel and ambitious nature cannot stop itself to lead the Lord on a path of cruelty to steal the power for himself once again, uncaring of the consequences of his own action.
