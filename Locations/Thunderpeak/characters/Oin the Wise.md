Oin the Wise was born into a poor family in Thunderpeak, struggling to make ends meet in a city where wealth and status were highly valued. However, despite his humble origins, Oin possessed a natural talent for history and lore, which he honed through countless hours of reading and studying in the public library.

One day, while Oin was working as a laborer in one of Thunderpeak's mines, he caught the attention of Chad Stonehelm, a prominent dwarf nobleman who was visiting the mine to oversee a new project. Impressed by Oin's intelligence and curiosity, Chad took the young boy under his wing and began mentoring him in the ways of scholarship and diplomacy.

Under Chad's guidance, Oin flourished, quickly becoming one of the most respected scholars in Thunderpeak. His knowledge and expertise were sought after by academics and lords throughout the land, and he became known as a wise and trusted advisor on matters of politics, warfare, and diplomacy.

Despite his success, Oin never forgot his humble beginnings, and he remained committed to using his knowledge and influence to help those less fortunate than himself.
