Thrain Ironfist was a human warrior who lived during the early years of the Age of Heroes. He was born in the region now known as the Jade Mountains, which at that time was inhabited by several tribes of humans and dwarves.

Thrain Ironfist was a larger-than-life figure, a towering warrior with rippling muscles and a fiery gaze that could strike fear into the hearts of his enemies. He had a wild beard that reached down to his chest, and his hair was braided into thick cords that swung like battle banners as he strode into battle.

Thrain's reputation as a legendary warrior preceded him wherever he went. He was said to have slain dragons with his bare hands, fought off hordes of orcs single-handedly, and even challenged the gods themselves to combat. Some claimed that he was invincible, that his skin was as hard as steel and that his sword was imbued with magical powers.

Despite his fearsome reputation, however, Thrain was a wise and compassionate leader, loved and respected by his people. He would often spend long hours listening to the concerns and grievances of his subjects, and would go to great lengths to ensure that they were well-fed and cared for.

Thrain's greatest legacy, however, was the city he founded: Thunderpeak. The city was a marvel of engineering and craftsmanship, with towering walls and gates made of solid stone, and buildings that seemed to reach up to the sky. The dwarves who lived there were renowned for their skill in mining and metalworking, and their wares were sought after throughout the land.

Thrain ruled over Thunderpeak for many years, until his final days, when he succumbed to the ravages of age. But his memory lived on, enshrined in songs and legends that celebrated his bravery and his greatness. And the city he founded continued to thrive, a testament to his vision and his leadership.
