[[Filip and Ki|Filip]], the foreman of the Crystal Caves, is in a bind. Not only have there been mysterious cave-ins spooking his miners, but now an infestation of exploding rats, seemingly originating from deeper within the caves, is jeopardizing operations. [[Filip and Ki|Filip]] needs you to investigate and deal with these problems before panic spreads among his crew. Also it seems that his partner in business, [[Filip and Ki|Ki]] has gone missing in the mines. 

As you delve deeper into the caves, you discover that the rats are not naturally explosive but have been corrupted by what appears to be a fungus parasite. You also find out that the cave-ins and the rat infestation are not unrelated. The disturbances in the cave structure seem to have agitated the normally passive rats, which seem to trigger explosions in random portions of the galleries.

Several puzzles can be involved in this quest:

1. **The Mine Map Puzzle:** To navigate the sprawling caves, the party will need a map. Getting one should be easy enough...
2. **The Crystal Resonance Puzzle:** Certain formations of crystals in the cave walls seem to be able to pacify the rats when they resonate at a certain frequency, while making them explode at other frequencies. The party needs to figure out how to replicate this resonance to create safe passage through areas thick with the explosive vermin and to rescue [[Filip and Ki|Ki]].

The quest will culminate in the revelation that [[Filip and Ki|Filip]] has betrayed the city in exchange of a favorable treatment by the cultist, and also suspects that he could be a member himself 

Defeating the Enchanted Armor will calm the rats, allowing for safe removal, and reveal the truth about the tragic history of the Crystal Caves. Gundrik, thankful for the party's efforts, rewards them with a precious gem mined from the caves and the promise of future work.
