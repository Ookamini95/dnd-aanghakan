Even during a siege, dwarves do not play with their alcohol. There should be some "emergency drinks" somewhere around the [[Crystal Caverns]]. 

>[[Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur|Bifur]] : Certainly nothing shady.
>[[Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur|Bofur]] : Definitely not contraband. 
>[[Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur|Bombur]] : Absolutely not Forgeborn Fury.

Forgeborn fury is a powerful ale, so much so that it can actually ignite and produce a decent sized explosion (cask : 3d6 fire damage). For this reason its production and trade has been forbidden. But that doesn't mean you can't get some of the stuff, at the right price.

The trio also warns the players about... "security measures", and give our team a simple map of the [[Deep Crystal Caverns]], just enough to reach the mechanism that reveals the hidden stash.

#Master-Notes 
With a decent roll they can be convinced to reveal some info about the security measures, else they will try to be as vague as possible. 

A possible additional challenge for the quest could involve a more complex version of the encounter and a switch to shut down the "security measures". Some pests from the caverns have recently damaged the mechanism and it may need a couple rolls to repair.
